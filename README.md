Consider the example shown in the diagram. The value of n is 3. There are 3 ways to reach the top. The diagram is taken from Easier Fibonacci puzzles

Examples: 


Input: n = 1
Output: 1
There is only one way to climb 1 stair

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
There are two ways: (1, 1) and (2)

Input: n = 4
Output: 5
(1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 2)
